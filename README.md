# RLAgent
Reinforcement learning based model by thinking on policies, goals, knowledge base, environment and reward function etc.

The Environment: AGENT WORLD
There are 5 components to take a note of,
1. Go to Power Position : On Reaching here, agent will start its next move
from “Power Position” as shown
2. Goal : The location of the goal should be randomly selected from the range
(x>5, y>5) eg. (6,6), (8,8), (8,6) etc., everytime the code is run, the goal
should change
3. Restart: The Agent will need to go restart and go to position (1,1)
4. Brown Blocks : Walls (Agent isn't allowed to penetrate through these
positions)
5. Start: Agent will be starting from (1,1) everytime the game is started.
